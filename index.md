## Welcome to Glagol DSL homepage

This is the homepage for the Glagol DSL project - development of microservices with ease. 

### What is Glagol DSL?
Glagol DSL is a domain specific language which focuses the development on the most important aspect - the domain implementation. Having an easy syntax with borrowed vocabulary from the Domain-Driven Design concepts and typical web framework patterns, Glagol establishes a headstart for every developer. Simply put, developers start business logic directly, without carrying too much for the surrounding _boilerplate_ code.  


### How it works?
Glagol DSL relies on transpiling (language-to-language compiling) and the output compiled sources are PHP sources with full framework configured environments.
